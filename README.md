# Mercator DB

Database model for the Mercator spatial index.

## Mercator: Spatial Index

**Mercator** is a spatial *volumetric* index for the [Human Brain Project](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu). It is a component of the [Knowledge Graph](http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/search/) service, which  provides the spatial anchoring for the metadata registered as well as processes the volumetric queries.

It is build on top of the Iron Sea database toolkit.

## Iron Sea: Database Toolkit

**Iron Sea** provides a set of database engine bricks, which can be combined and applied on arbitrary data structures.

Unlike a traditional database, it does not assume a specific physical structure for the tables nor the records, but relies on the developper to provide a set of extractor functions which are used by the specific indices provided.

This enables the index implementations to be agnostic from the underlying data structure, and re-used.

## Requirements

### Software

 * Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org

## Quick start

## Building from sources

To build this project, you will need to run the following:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

### Installation

To install the software on the system you can use:

```sh
cargo install --release
```

### Usage

The binary `db-test` provided is used only as an integration test at this point. It will convert a json input to a binary representation, before building an index over it. Once this is achieved, it will run a couple of hard-coded queries over the index.

```sh
cargo run --release
```

## Documentation

For more information, please refer to the [documentation](https://epfl-dias.github.io/PROJECT_NAME/).

If you want to build the documentation and access it locally, you can use:

```sh
cargo doc --open
```
